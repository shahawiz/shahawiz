# Hi, I'm Hossam


I am an all round software engineer who loves coffee. Not just any regular coffee, I prefer a very strong Turkish one.
I like working in a team, you’ll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes:
two heads are better than one .

I am a software engineer with good knowledge of backend techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps , also I’m in love with cloud and servers as I have a passion about security, cloud infrastructure , web hosting and I’m a Linux🐧 fan boy.
